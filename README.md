# Linear regression with multiple variables
In this project we will implement linear regression with multiple variables to predict the prices of houses. The project is an optional exercise from the ["Machine Learning" course from Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/).

The task is described as follows:
Suppose you are selling your house and you want to know what a good market price would be. One way to do this is to
first collect information on recent houses sold and make a model of housing prices.
The file `ex1data2.txt` contains a training set of housing prices in Portland, Oregon. The first column is the size of the house (in square feet), the second column is the number of bedrooms, and the third column is the price of the house.
